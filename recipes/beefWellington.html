        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place beef in a small baking dish, and
                <br>spread with 2 tablespoons softened butter. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until
                <br>browned. Remove from pan, and allow to cool completely. Reserve pan juices.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Saute onion and mushrooms
                <br>in butter for 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and let cool.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Mix together pate and 2 tablespoons softened butter, and season with salt and
                <br>pepper. Spread pate over beef. Top with onion and mushroom mixture.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Roll out the puff pastry dough, and place beef in the center. Fold up, and seal all the
                <br>edges, making sure the seams are not too thick. Place beef in a 9x13 inch baking dish,
                <br>cut a few slits in the top of the dough, and brush with egg yolk.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to 425 degrees
                <br>F (220 degrees C) for 10 to 15 more minutes, or until pastry is a rich, golden brown.
                <br>Set aside, and keep warm.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Place all reserved juices in a small saucepan over high heat. Stir in beef stock and red
                <br>wine; boil for 10 to 15 minutes, or until slightly reduced. Strain, and serve with beef.
